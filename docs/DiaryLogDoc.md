# Diary Log

Last updated: 2025-09-30 12:10 local

Purpose
- Keep a chronological, developer-facing log of prompts, decisions, errors, rollbacks, and reasoning tied to repository changes.
- Complement SpecDoc (intent/requirements/acceptance) and CodeStyleDoc (conventions). The Diary is narrative and time-ordered.

How We Use This Diary
- Add an entry for every meaningful change, decision, or incident (including build failures and rollbacks).
- Keep entries concise but explicit about what changed and why.
- Reference commits, PRs, or issue slice names when available.
- Prefer local time in the header; include ISO-8601 if cross-timezone clarity is needed.

Entry Template
- Timestamp: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm local>
- Context: <prompt/issue/slice>
- Decisions: <key decisions made>
- Changes: <files or areas touched>
- Errors/Rollbacks: <if any>
- Reasoning: <summary of rationale>
- Follow-ups: <next actions>

  Context: Slice 3 â€” Add DiaryLogDoc.md and keep all three docs in sync
  Decisions: Introduce docs/DiaryLogDoc.md as a living chronological log; update SpecDoc and CodeStyleDoc to reference and require ongoing maintenance of all three docs.
  Changes: Added DiaryLogDoc.md; plan to update SpecDoc (Slice 2 status Completed; add Slice 3) and CodeStyleDoc (Diary conventions).
  Errors/Rollbacks: None.
  Reasoning: Improves traceability of prompts, decisions, and rationale over time.
  Follow-ups: Ensure build stays green; commit and push to main; continue logging future slices and incidents.
